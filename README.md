# Introduction
- Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. 
- It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. 
- It has two parts:- 
1) a client-side library that runs in the browser 
2) a server-side library for node.js. Both components have an identical API.
# Real-time applications
- A real-time application (RTA) is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as immediate or current.
- Some examples of real-time applications are :-
1) Instant messengers − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.
2) Push Notifications − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly.
3) Collaboration Applications − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances.
4) Online Gaming − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.
